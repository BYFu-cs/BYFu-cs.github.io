Many people want to see the behavior of the client when building their own web pages. There is no doubt that client-facing analytics can always help web administrators run their web pages better. Here's how to count traffic and increase exposure for your website.<br/>
<br/>

## Count Traffic
The following content is based on Google Analytics.<br/>
You can click here to visit: [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web).

### Step 1.
You should create your own account in **Google Analytics**, and then create a recognizable name in the account for the data stream that belongs to you.<br/>
<br/>
### Step 2.
Open '**Admin**' in the bottom left corner of the page. Then open '**Data collection and modification**' in the '**Property settings**' popup on the left. You should select the '**Data Streams**' entry.The image below shows my workspace, where ids have been processed for privacy reasons.<br/>
![DataStreams]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/Fun_Blog1/DataStreams.png)<br/>
<br/>
### Step 3.
Click on your data stream, and then in the '**Web stream details**' row to the bottom of the page. Locate the '**view tag instructions**' TAB in '**Google tag**' and click on it.<br/>
![InstallationInstructions]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/Fun_Blog1/InstallationInstructions.png)<br/>
<br/>
The **Tracking Code** of your personsal is as follows:<br/>

~~~js
<!-- Google tag (gtag.js) -->
<script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id="xxxxxxxxxx"></script>
<script>
  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
  function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
  gtag('js', new Date());

  gtag('config', 'xxxxxxxxxx');
</script>
~~~

You only need to substitue the id into yourself's.
