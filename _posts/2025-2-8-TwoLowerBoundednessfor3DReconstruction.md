By employing scattered point data, our approach reconstructs smooth narrow volumes using a phase-field Allenâ€“Cahn model with a control function. The proposed method ensures energy dissipation and smooth surface throughout the reconstruction process. By introducing an auxiliary variable, the nonlinear term in the governing equation is reformulated, allowing for efficient time-marching schemes. The fully discrete scheme is linear, and its unconditional stability is rigorously estimated. Numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the energy stability, accuracy, and effectiveness of our proposed methods in various 3D reconstruction tasks, establishing its broad applicability.
