On the road to machine learning, we will find that the basic algorithms are inseparable from the knowledge of mathematical statistics. This blog is to assist you to better understand Confidence Interval and Confidence Level from fundamental concepts to practical instances.<br/>

# 1.Fundamental definition and feature.
## 1.1 T-test (T-distribution).
### 1.1.1 Definition of T-test.
In general,T-test can be classified as three tests: Single Population Test, Double Population Test, and Paired Sample Test.Without doubt, T-test is closely related to the T-distribution.To simplify our problem, we only consider **Single Population Test** as our topic.<br/>
